# FT2232 oscilloscope raster drawing
This application can be used to draw raster images on analog oscilloscope using FT2232HC-based dev board, some counters and registers.

Supports `X to Y`, `X to Y interleaved` and `Y to X` modes.

Work in progress, maybe it will be merged with 
[FT2232ImageOutput](https://github.com/wwwMADwww/FT2232ImageOutput) in future.
